% function: computeLeastSquares()
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Description:  For a given eeg matrix, compute least squares for a 
% 1st order multivariate autoregressive model. The model is such:
%
%   Y(t) = SUM(X_ij*Y(t-1))
%   where x is X_ij vectorized.
%
% Optional to add regularization.
% 
% Performs x = min( ||Ax-b|| ) as the general problem, but must perform
% some reorganization of the eeg matrix and put it into a sparse matrix
%
% Assumptions:
% 1. MVAR assumes stationarity of the window of data chosen.
% 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%   
%   Input: 
%   1. eegMat: CxT matrix, with C channels and T time points, 
%   2. observationVector: Tx1 vector, the b vector
%   3. OPTIONS: 
%       - l2regularization: (1, 0) 
%
%   Output: 
%   x: a vector of the weights of the X_ij in the MVAR model.
%
