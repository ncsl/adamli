%eeg_mtwelch
%Written by: Julio I. Chapeton
%
%Calculates the spectrum and t-f representation of a signal using a short time fourier transform (STFT).
%These can be calculated with multitapers, no tapers, or a Hann taper. The spectrum is produced by averaging the STFTs.
%The t-f representation is calculated using multitapers at each STDFT. The amplitdues and power are scaled correctly for all cases except for multitapers
%
%Usage:
%eeg_mtwelch(eeg,Fs,T,overlap,TW,varargin)
%
%Inputs:
%    Required:
%        eeg      = matrix (trials x time)
%        Fs       = scalar (sampling frequency in Hz)
%        T        = scalar (size of the time window in seconds)
%        overlap  = scalar (size of overlap for adjacent windows, as a fraction of T)
%        TW       = scalar (time-bandwidth product, 2*TW-1 will be the number of tapers)
%        freqOut  = vector (range of output frequencies), pass in empty matrix [] for full freqs_FFT output
%   Optional:
%        method   = string ('no tapers' uses rectangular windows,'eigen' will average the...
%                          power over tapers using the eigenvalues as weights,'Hann' uses a Hann window, may change this to be the default)
%
%Outputs:
%        powMT    = matrix (trial x freq x timestep, power has been normalized to conserve the energy in the signal)
%        phsMT    = matrix (trial x freq x timestep, phase from first taper)
%        freqs_FFT= vector (vector of frequencies in Hz where the power was calculated)
%        t_sec    = matrix (window start/stop times)
%  --following are no longer output now that eeg is trials x time--
%        fx       = array  (contains the power of the windowed data, of the form (freq x window x taper) i.e. not averaged over tapers yet)
%        SP       = vector (spectrum up to Fnyquist, these are normalized to give the correct amplitudes in Volts)
%        all_phase=        (Not set yet)
