# Fragility Algorithm Sensitivity Analysis
Created: 2/15/17

In this directory, I am keeping code for testing the sensitivity of the fragility heatmap to electrodes within the epileptic network.

My initial experiments will involve taking a well analyzed patient (e.g. NIH pt1sz2) and computing fragility with varying numbers of electrodes missing from the network. I will repeat this until it becomes difficult to distinguish the EZ electrodes. I will also look for analyzing which electrodes are important, if any specifically in the EZ detection.
